## 🚀 Features

- 🔎 **Search Algorithms**: Visualizes linear and binary search.
- 🔃 **Sorting Algorithms**: Includes Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and more.
- 🔗 **Graph Traversal**: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).
- 🧠 **Educational Panel**: Displays definitions, time complexities, pseudocode, and images related to the selected algorithm.
- 🧭 **Step-by-Step Execution**: Walk through each step with controls to start, stop, reset, and resume.
- 🎨 **Code Display**: Highlights active lines of pseudocode during execution.
- 📊 **Graphical Representation**: Built using Matplotlib for visual clarity.
